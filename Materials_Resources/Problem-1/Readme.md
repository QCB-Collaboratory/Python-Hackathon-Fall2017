# Analysis of calcium imaging

In this problem, we will practice a number of common methodologies for the analysis of images and calcium traces based on videos. Differently to the other projects proposed in this Hackathon, this project is more educational and aims at giving hands-on practice with Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Using videos of fluorescent calcium-indicator Oregon Green in endothelial cells, we will practice:

1. a simple method to segment cells;
2. extract fluorescence time series of a set of cells;
3. and estimate their calcium concentration and other population statistics.

As extra activities, participants may also use this dataset to learn how to automate pipelines for image processing and create videos such as [this one](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-017-01741-8/MediaObjects/41467_2017_1741_MOESM4_ESM.mp4) using a few lines of code in Python.

The dataset used in this problem was kindly provided by [Dr. Julia Mack](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julia-mack-0790a52/) from the [Arispe Lab](https://arispelab.mcdb.ucla.edu/), and was used in [their recent publication on Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01741-8).

### Primary goal

From the discussions in the Hackathon, we will publish a notebook which will provide an example of how to extract and analyse calcium dynamics form a video. This notebook will be available publicly to everyone, and other people from the QCBio community will be able to use it as an additional resource for this kind of analysis.
