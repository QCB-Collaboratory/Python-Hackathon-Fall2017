    "The hok/sok system is a postsegregational killing mechanism employed by the R1 plasmid in Escherichia coli. […] The hok/sok system involves two genes:\n",
    "- hok, host killing : RNA with a long lifetime, its protein is toxic\n",
    "- sok, suppression of killing : RNA with a short lifetime, RNA antitoxin\n",
    "\n",
    "When E. coli undergoes cell division, the two daughter cells inherit the long-lived hok toxin from the parent cell. Due to the short half-life of the sok antitoxin, daughter cells inherit only small amounts and it quickly degrades.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a daughter cell has inherited the R1 plasmid, it has inherited the sok gene and a strong promoter which brings about high levels of transcription. So much so that in an R1-positive cell, Sok transcript exists in considerable molar excess over Hok mRNA. Sok RNA then indirectly inhibits the translation of hok by inhibiting mok translation. There is a complementary region where sok transcript binds hok mRNA directly (pictured). Instead, sok RNA regulates the translation of the mok open reading frame, which nearly entirely overlaps that of hok. It is this translation-coupling which effectively allows sok RNA to repress the translation of hok mRNA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sok transcript forms a duplex with the leader region of hok mRNA and this is recognized by RNase III and degraded. The cleavage products are very unstable and soon decay.\n",
