# Web crawler to connect with SignalP server



This dataset [Rob Foreman](https://github.com/rfor10) from the [Wollman Lab](http://wollman.chem.ucla.edu/).


### Goal

During the Hackathon, we will develop a python script or module that automates the detection of cleavage sites of signal peptide in sequences of aminoacid. This module should control for how often the requests are made, and how the output files are saved.


### Technical challenges

* Automating genomics analyses based on online applications

* Learning how to construct web crawlers


### Guideline

1. Read about


### Resources

* Read a little bit about [web crawlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler). They are extremely useful in many areas, including the automation of the use of online applications that do not offer APIs.
