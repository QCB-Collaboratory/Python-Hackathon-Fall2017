# Python Hackathon
**QCBio Collaboratory**


Many of you who enjoyed the Collaboratory workshops have requested the opportunity to continue improving your computational skills beyond the workshop. We're pleased to announce a new event for those with interest in computational and quantitative methods in biology: **a Hackathon dedicated to solving problems of interest to our community**, using Python.

Our idea is to organize a Hackathon over a single day, and spend this day solving a couple of coding problems. To ensure that these problems are of relevance to a large number of people, we are asking for everyone interested to submit suggestions of problems that you, or colleagues, may want help tackling. This is a great opportunity to get help with a problem you're stuck on as we learn together how to overcome coding challenges. With a set of relevant problems, we can offer tailored assistance in advanced topics with Python, creating a stronger connection between the contents of our workshop and your research and going beyond the basic material provided by the current Collaboratory workshop. The hackathon is suitable for anyone who regularly uses or wishes to regularly use Python for their research, regardless of their level of expertise with programming. The only requirement is the Introduction to Python workshop.

## When? Where?

* **Date:** December 8th, 2017
* **Where:** Collaboratory Classroom (Boyer Hall 529),
Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biology, UCLA
* **What time:** between 9:00AM and 5:00PM

## Registration and contact

To register, follow this link: [https://goo.gl/forms/k4LMeEB9SzwEBVX42](https://goo.gl/forms/k4LMeEB9SzwEBVX42)

To ensure that the problems used in the Hackathon are of relevance to a large number of people, during the registration we ask for suggestions of problems that you, or colleagues, may want help tackling. These suggestions can be anything, and you don't need to submit a solution, just a small description of the problem. Examples of types of problems: changing file format from one standard to another; automating a task or pipeline for many datasets; optimize the computation time of complex analyses and pipelines; applying basic methods of computer vision to segment images (e.g. for cell detection); building predictive models (e.g. using Machine Learning techniques); solving a model of ODEs to fit your data; etc.


## Schedule

To be announced soon!!


## Coding problems

During the Hackathon, we will be solving together the following problems. You should feel free to participate in as many problems you want. **The list of problems may be updated until the date of the event.**

1. [**Extracting calcium imaging.**](./Materials_Resources/Problem-1/) We will use videos of fluorescent calcium indicator Oregon Green in endothelial cells to practice how to extract fluorescence time series of a set of cells and estimate their calcium concentration.

2. [**Simulating protein expression with the Gillespie method.**](./Materials_Resources/Problem-2/) ...

3. [**Automating a pipeline for image processing.**](./Materials_Resources/Problem-3/) Using a single-molecule Fluorescence-in-Situ-Hybridization dataset, we will explore how to automate a simple pipeline for image processing in Python using parallel techniques.

4. [**Web crawler to find signal peptides.**](./Materials_Resources/Problem-4/) Let's construct a web crawler that automatically submits to the [SignalP 4.1 Server](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/), which predicts the presence and location of signal peptide cleavage sites in aminoacid sequences.

5. [**Recording fluorescence using camera and arduino.**](./Materials_Resources/Problem-5/) Let's design and set up a small system to simultaneously control an LED array and a camera to record a fluorescence tracer such as fluorescein.


## Who is this Hackathon intended for?

The hackathon is suitable for anyone who regularly uses or wishes to regularly use Python for their research, regardless of their level of expertise with programming. The only requirement is the Introduction to Python workshop.
